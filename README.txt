Introduction
--------------

*transmogrifier.ploneremote* is package of transmogrifier blueprints for 
uploading content via Zope XML-RPC API to a Plone site.

Plone site does not need any modifications, but vanilla Zope XML-RPC is used.

Usage
-----

Five different blueprints are provided.

Common Options
==============

target
  Url of Plone folder to upload content. You will need to include the username and
  password using the url syntax. e.g. http://user:password@site.com/folder.
  If you'd prefer not to hardcode your password in a pipeline.cfg you can use
  `mr.migrator` which lets you override your pipeline using the commandline.

path-key
  Which blueprint item dictionary key is used to extract the remote path information
  or the item. Default value *path* .


transmogrify.ploneremote.constructor
====================================

Drop in replacement for constructor that will use xmlprc calls to construct content on a remote plone site

Options
~~~~~~~

target
  see `Common Options`

path-key
  see `Common Options`

type-key
  Key of the field with item type to create. Defaults to 'type','portal_type', 'Type','_type'

creation-key
  Key of the field to determine if item should be created. Defaults to '_creation_flag'

create-condition
  TAL expression to determine if item should be added. Defaults to 'python:True'

move-condition
  If the content has already been uploaded and then moved this TAL expression
  will determine if the content should be moved back. Default is 'python:True'

remove-condition
  If the content has already been uploaded and is of a different type this
  TAL expression will determine if the item can be removed and recreated.



transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteschemaupdater
============================================

This will use XML-RPC to call Archetypes setXXX() mutator methods remotely
to set field values.

TODO: How to input schema fields

Options

target
  see `Common Options`

path-key
  see `Common Options`

condition
  TAL Expression to determine to use this blueprint

skip-existing
  Default is 'False'


transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteworkflowupdater
==============================================

Triggers the state transition of the remote item workflow i.e.
publishes the item if it is not public.

Options
~~~~~~~

target
  see `Common Options`

path-key
  see `Common Options`

transitions-key
  which blueprint item dictionary key is used as the transition name
  for the item. 


transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteredirector
=========================================

This blueprint adds redirection aliases to those content items that have changed
it's paths during tranmogrification process. It takes into account item's
*_orig_path* key set by webcrawler blueprint. Redirection uses
Products.RedirectionTool Aliases form to add appropriate redirections. So this
is required to install that addon in order to make
*transmogrify.ploneremote.redirector* blueprint work.

If *path* is not equal to *orig_path* then appropriate aliases is being added
to local Plone utility (IRedirectionStorage) using Aliases form.


Example::

        #
        # Add content aliases for content that changed it's paths
        # 
        [redirector]
        blueprint = transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteredirector
